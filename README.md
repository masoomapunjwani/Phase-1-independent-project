## Getting Started

**To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:**

### Prerequisites
You need an IDE of your choice (preferably Visual Studio Code).
You will need a browser (preferably Chrome) to view the webpage.
You need to have installed npm and JSON-server on your local machine. 

### Setup
Clone the project using these links depending on your local environment:

### Install
- On the root folder, locate the ``index.html`` and open with your IDE
- Run LiveServer to open the page on your default browser.

- If you haven't installed json-server, use ``npm -i -g json-server`` to install the server on a global scope
- Open terminal and navigate into the assets folder, run ``ls`` to check if a file ```db.json``` is present then run ``json-server --watch db.json`` to start the server.

### Usage
- Make sure your json-server is running for the app to work as intended.
- The project does not need an internet connection to work because information is fetched from your local server.

### Run tests
- If json-server is not running, dummy Questions and Answers will be displayed.
